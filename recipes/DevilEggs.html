        </p>
        <h3><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large free-range eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 tsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp English mustard</li>
            <li>Few drops of Tabasco</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp water from a freshly boiled kettle</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong><u>Step by Step Guide</u></strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring some water to the boil in a large saucepan and, once it’s boiling, add the eggs, one by one, into the pan and bring back to the boil. Boil for 1 minute, then turn the heat off and leave the eggs to stand in the pan for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>While you’re waiting for the eggs to cook, fill a large bowl with very cold water, and throw in a handful of ice cubes if you have them. As soon as the eggs have had their 12 minutes, spoon them into the cold water and leave for 15 minutes – no longer – before peeling patiently and carefully.</li>
            <li>Halve the eggs lengthways and gently prise the yolk out of each half and pop them into a mixing bowl. Place the neatest looking 18 halved whites on a plate or two</li>
            <li>Add the mayonnaise, a teaspoon of English mustard, the salt and paprika to the egg yolks, and shake a few drops of Tabasco on top. Stir and mash with a fork, then blend with a stick blender or in a food processor. Add the oil and blend again until smooth. It will be very thick. Check for seasoning and also taste to see if you want this hotter. I generally go up to 2 teaspoons of mustard and quite a bit more Tabasco, but it’s best to proceed slowly. Now, by hand, stir in as much of the water as you need to help form a piping consistency</li>
            <li>Spoon the golden mixture into a piping bag with a star icing nozzle, making sure it is densely packed at the bottom of the bag. Then pipe away, filling the hollowed-out whites with golden rosettes. Or you can mound the yolk mixture using a pair of teaspoons. Sprinkle with paprika and chopped chives and serve with a flourish.</li>
