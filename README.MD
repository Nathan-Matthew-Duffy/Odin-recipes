# Odin Recipes Project

This is my first project from The Odin Project.  
It will help me practice the Git workflow, HTML basics, and working with a real repository.  
Once finished, Iâ€™ll have demonstrated skills in creating a simple website, writing clean code, and using Git & GitHub effectively.
